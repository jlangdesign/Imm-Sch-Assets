# Immersive Scholar assets
Assets for the [Immersive Scholar](https://www.immersivescholar.org/) project.

1. **Logos:** Black and white, square and horizontal (PNG).
2. **Wall mockup templates:** Photoshop templates (PSD) for the four video walls at Hunt. Just double-click on the thumbnail with the name of the wall (i.e. "art wall," "commons wall," "ipearl theater," "vis wall"), drop your file into the PSB (smart object source file) you're taken to, and save.
3. **Wall grids:** Illustrator wireframe templates (AI) for the four video walls at Hunt. Can use this to play around with layouts and find the best way to align your content to the tile grids.
